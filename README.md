## 🌟 About the Piscine

The **42 Piscine** is an intense four-week coding bootcamp designed to push students to their limits. During this time, we:

- Delved deep into C programming 🖥️
- Mastered shell scripting and automation ⚙️
- Tackled complex problems with a focus on algorithms and data structures 📊
- Learned to thrive in a collaborative and competitive environment 🤝

## 🏆 Projects Overview

Here’s a breakdown of the key projects and exercises I worked on:

### Shell Projects 🐚

- **Shell00:**
  - **Exercises:** Basic shell commands, scripting, and file manipulation.
  - **Challenge:** Writing simple scripts to automate tasks.

- **Shell01:**
  - **Exercises:** Advanced shell scripting, loops, and conditionals.
  - **Challenge:** Creating more complex scripts to manage system tasks.

### C Programming Challenges 🧑‍💻

- **C00 - C09:**
  - **C00:** BasiC of C, variables, data types, and simple I/O.
  - **C01:** Control structures, loops, and logic.
  - **C02:** Functions, recursion, and basic algorithms.
  - **C03:** Pointers, memory allocation, and arrays.
  - **C04:** Strings, string manipulation, and memory management.
  - **C05:** Structs, file I/O, and basic data structures.
  - **C06:** Advanced data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues).
  - **C07:** Sorting algorithms and complexity analysis.
  - **C08:** Dynamic memory management and multi-dimensional arrays.
  - **C09:** Advanced algorithms, searching, and optimization.

### Final Project 🏁

- **C11:**
  - **Objective:** Apply everything learned to solve a comprehensive set of challenges.
  - **Challenge:** This project was a culmination of all the concepts learned, testing my ability to write efficient and well-structured C code.
